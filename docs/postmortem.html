								Expectations</h3>
						</header>
						<p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75);">
							From the start, this project made us both excited and nervous. We had a big task ahead, with
							a team of 23 students, using an engine we created last semester. The size of the project was
							intimidating. But we felt confident knowing that previous classes had managed to do it.
						</p>
						<p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75);">
							We saw this project as a great chance to test our skills and work together. The idea of
							turning our concepts into a real game was both exciting and motivating. We knew it would be
							tough, needing careful planning, good communication, and a lot of effort. As we progressed,
							our determination grew stronger, and we were more committed to overcoming any challenges.
						</p>
						<p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75);">
							Looking back, our expectations changed over time. What started as nervous anticipation
							turned into a strong drive to succeed. This project tested our skills and tried to brought
							us closer
							as a team.</p>

								What Went Okay</h3>

						<h3 class="production-info" style="font-size: large; color: rgb(88, 202, 255)">Hard Work</h3>
						</header>
						<p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75); margin-bottom: 60px;">
							A lot of people have been hard at work from the beginning, always willing to work extra if
							someone else failed.
						</p>

						<h3 class="production-info" style="font-size: large; color: rgb(88, 202, 255)">Adaption</h3>
						</header>
						<p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75); margin-bottom: 60px;">
							When we figured out the original design for the game had been too ambitious, we quickly
							changed it and made it smaller so that it was possible to deliver a complete game.

							</h3>

						<p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75); margin-bottom: 60px;">
							Regardless of the issues, we ended up delivering a valuable result and all the effort we put
							in the project has been reflected in it.

								What Could Be Improved</h3>

						<h3 class="production-info" style="font-size: large; color: rgb(88, 202, 255)">Communication
						</h3>
						</header>
						<p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75); margin-bottom: 60px;">
							We dealt with a lot of issues with communication during the development. Not updating the
							HacknPlan regardless of how many times they’re reminded to do so, not attending meetings to
							explain what’s going on, and not answering messages. This is a point it could have been
							improved, specially taking into account what was our final goal, making a videogame and
							simulate the work pipeline and process as if we were a professional studio.
						</p>
						<header>
							<h3 class="production-info" style="font-size: large; color: rgb(88, 202, 255)">Transparency
								& Respect
							</h3>
						</header>
						<p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75); ;">
							Some people in the project refused to be transparent about their work. Some said something
							was done when it wasn’t, sometimes it was not saying they couldn’t finish something so they
							needed help and, of course, when a group of coders decided to work on a secret second build
							without telling anyone and completely stopped working in the main one, even with that it
							seems that group considers to have learned how to work as a team in this project. The last
							issue also ties in with the lack of respect, not only were both the lead and producer
							disrespected by the fact of an alternate build but it continued with snide comments or a
							complete refusal to listen when talked to.

							<h3 class="production-info" style="color: orange; margin-top: 100px;">Conclusions</h3>
						</header>
						<p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75);">
							This project has really shown why the principles of Scrum are so important when in big
							groups, even if sadly it has been from the side of these needing to be fulfilled. Even if we
							might have been able to deliver a game, the lack of trust, transparency, respect, and
							openness has left this project with a dark mark.
						</p>
						<p style="color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.75);">
							It is difficult to see the positives with such a dark cloud hanging over everything but
							while, particularly these last couple of milestones, have been bad, the work that has been
							done and the willingness of some people to help have really helped with the project in all
							its milestones.
